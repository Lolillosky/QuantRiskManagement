# Correlating Random Samples

The other day we saw in the class that if $\phi^I$ is a vector of $m$ independent random variables and we multiply them by a $\underset{m\times m}{M}$ matrix we get:

$$\phi^C=M\phi^I$$

where $$\phi^C$$ now has covariance matrix:

$$C=MM^T$$

Can you justify this result?

Therefore, whenever we want to correlate random variables with covariance matrix $C$ we must first find a matrix M, such that $C=MM^T$
