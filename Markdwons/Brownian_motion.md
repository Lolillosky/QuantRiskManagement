# Brownian motion

The other day we kind of built Brownian motion from a discrete process. For the process to be continuous, we made the variance to depend on $\Delta t^{\gamma}$ and saw that unless $\gamma = 1/2$ the process variance either expoded or vanished as $\Delta t \to 0$. Why is this the case?
